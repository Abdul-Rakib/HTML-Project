<h3>Bhutan is on a path of transformation: Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Dr Lotay Tshering-led Bhutan government turned three years on Monday and the PM thanked the citizens of the country for their support and encouragement.</p>

<p>“As it officially turns three years since we took office, I wanted to take the opportunity to thank everyone for the support and encouragement so far. In our sincere efforts to make each day count, the years have just flashed past,” PM Tshering said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/410112025768173/posts/4463778670401468/?d=n">Facebook</a> post.</p>
    
<p>“But the recent years have also been the most difficult in our lifetime. It pains to recall the months of lockdown that pounded so much hardship and threatened our lives. Even after all this, the disconcerting fact is that we are not out of the woods yet,” Dr Tshering said recalling the days of lockdown.</p>

<p>The pandemic claimed millions of lives across the world and the risk prevails even today.

“For us, our biggest blessing is that we are living in a GNH country under the leadership of His Majesty The King. We lived a fairly comfortable life when the invisible virus fundamentally impacted the world in an unprecedented way,” the Bhutan PM stated.</p>
